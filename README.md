AppInventor resources for CoderDojoTC mentors

[AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/about-us.html) is a free program from MIT for making Android apps.  It's easy for beginners to use, but has powerful capabilities for creating fully functional complex apps. Newcomers to App Inventor can have their first app up and running in an hour or less, and can program more complex apps in significantly less time than with more traditional, text-based languages.

There are excellent tutorials on the AppInventor web site.   Before mentoring at CoderDojoTC it would be great if you went through the start up procedure and used the tutorial to make a few apps (e.g Hello Purr, and either Paint Pot or Magic 8 ball)

This wiki has a summary of some of the tutorials available for AppInventor2.

The laptops at CoderDojoTC will have AppInventor and the emulator loaded.   Please familiarize yourself with the download process, because many kids bring their own computers and will need to download the software before beginning.

Thank you for mentoring at CoderDojoTC!
